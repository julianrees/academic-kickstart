# History and Development
The development of HOPO Therapeutics' flagship active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) began under the purview of the US Department of Energy, with the aim of creating a pill that could be used to protect and treat people in a nuclear disaster scenario. After extensive investigation and testing, the experimental agent 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) emerged as a promising candidate capable of binding and removing the heavy metals plutonium and americium. These radioactive elements, found in the actinide row of the f-block on the periodic table, are of great concern for human and environmental health in the event of a radiological incident. An effective drug treatment for exposure to these elements must be able to bind to, or ***chelate***, the toxic metal atoms, and promote their prompt excretion from the body. 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), our flagship API, has several properties that make it exceptionally suited to serve as a protective treatment in this scenario.

### Selectivity
Due to its size and molecular shape, the API chelates the f-block elements of the periodic table, but does not chelate metal atoms that are essential for the body's function, such as iron, zinc, and calcium. Currently-available interventions for heavy metal contamination, including EDTA and DTPA, will deplete the body's supply of these essential elements.

### Oral Availability
The easiest way to treat a large population group is by distribution of an oral medication. In pre-clinical studies, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) shows good oral availability and efficacy, indicating that the API can maintain efficacy when formulated as an oral capsule.

### Rapid Clearance
Heavy metals are excreted quickly once bound by 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO). This ensures that the body is exposed to a minimum amount of radiation following exposure.

### Prophylactic and Delayed Efficacy
The API effectively removes heavy metals from the body when used either as a prophylaxis or when administered days or weeks following contamination. It can therefore be used to provide protection to first responders in a nuclear disaster scenario, as well as to treat people that have already been exposed.
