The development of HOPO Therapeutics' flagship active pharmaceutical ingredient, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), began with the aim of [creating a pill that could be used to protect and treat people in a nuclear disaster scenario](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/09/12/how-an-anti-nuclear-contamination-pill-could-also-help-mri-patients/). After extensive investigation and pre-clinical evaluation, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) emerged as a promising candidate capable of binding to, or ***chelating***, heavy metals and removing them from the body. It has several properties that make it exceptionally suited to serve as a chelating agent for heavy metal toxicity.

### Selectivity
The therapeutic interventions that are currently available for the treatment of heavy metal contamination, including EDTA and DTPA, will deplete the body's supply of metal ions that are essential for the body's function, such as iron, zinc, and calcium. Due to its size and molecular shape, the 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) chelates the f-block elements of the periodic table, including gadolinium, but does not chelate any essential ions. *[Read more](/publication/bunin-dose-dependent-2013/)*

### Oral Availability
The most convenient drug delivery route is an oral medication. This allows for easy self-administration, and is ideal for rapid distribution and treatment for a large population. In pre-clinical studies, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) shows good oral availability, and it maintains efficacy when formulated as an oral capsule. *[Read more](/publication/choi-biodistribution-2015/)*

### Prophylactic and Delayed Efficacy
3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) effectively removes heavy metals from the body when used either as a prophylaxis or when administered days or weeks following contamination. It can be used to provide protection prior to exposure to heavy metals, *e.g.* to protect first responders in a nuclear disaster scenario, as well as to treat patients that have already been contaminated. *[Read more](/publication/an-early-2017/)*

### Rapid Clearance
Heavy metals are excreted quickly once bound by 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO). This ensures that heavy metals spend a minimal amount of time in the body.
