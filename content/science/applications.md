## Heavy Metal Contamination
The chelating agent 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) has been specifically optimized for the selective binding of heavy metals, and it promotes their removal from the body. This umbrella application has multiple use cases across several sectors, including radiology and MRI contrast agents, environmental exposures and public health concerns, defense and disaster preparedness, and nuclear energy research, waste treatment, and power plant operations.

## Specific Use Cases

### Gadolinium From MRI Contrast Agents
There are over 15 million magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures performed in the United States each year that utilize an injected gadolinium-based contrast agent, or GBCA. The release of the toxic heavy metal gadolinium from these GBCAs *[results in gadolinium deposition](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-warns-gadolinium-based-contrast-agents-gbcas-are-retained-body)* throughout the body, and can lead to serious health complications. Currently there is no way to prevent or treat gadolinium deposition, and the diagnostic benefits of the contrast MRI are generally accepted to outweigh the risks.

In preclinical studies, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) enabled the *[effective prevention of gadolinium deposition](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22511-6)*. Our oral formulation enables the course of treatment we believe will be the most effective at preventing gadolinium deposition: a regimen of pills taken in the days following contrast MRI to ensure that gadolinium released into the body from the GBCA compound will be chelated and excreted from the body, instead of depositing in the kidneys, brain, and bones.

We are evaluating the efficacy of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) for removal of pre-existing, deposited gadolinium from patients who have already received GBCAs. The design of an effective dosing strategy requires a detailed knowledge of the compound's pharmacokinetics in humans - information we anticipate will be available following our first-in-human clinical trial.

Finally, *[The American College of Radiology advises against the use of GBCAs for patients with impaired kidney function](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Clinical-Resources/Contrast_Media.pdf)* due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), making those individuals ineligible for MRI or MR angiography (MRA) with gadolinium-based contrast.  Instead, patients with kidney disease often undergo alternative imaging procedures using ionizing radiation, such as CT or PET. GBCAs are normally cleared from the body through the kidneys, however the primary excretion route of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) is via the liver. Using the compound to reduce the strain on the kidneys associated with clearing a large dose of GBCA could enable patients with kidney disease to undergo contrast MRI and MRA procedures, giving physicians ideal diagnostic information, and avoiding unnecessary exposure to radiation.


### Public Health and Environmental Heavy Metal Exposure
The historic and ongoing use of heavy metals such as cadmium and lead have resulted in several incidents of human exposure to these toxic elements, often from contaminated drinking water supply. Events such as the 2014 Flint, Michigan crisis have highlighted ***the lack of an effective treatment for lead poisoning.*** Lead is a destructive and cumulative toxin that is particularly harmful to children, and [has been estimated to account for roughly 10% of global cases of hypertensive heart disease, 5.6% of global cases of ischemic heart disease, and 6% of global instances of ischemic stroke.](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lead-poisoning-and-health) ***We believe that lead poisoning should be treatable,*** and we are investigating how 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) can safely and effectively reduce the amount of lead in the body following exposure.

### Radiological Disaster Preparedness
The oral formulation of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) has been designed to provide a safe, easily distributed, effective treatment in a large-scale radiological incident. Additionally, the excellent prophylactic efficacy observed in preclinical studies suggests that 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) can provide an effective means to protect first responders, nuclear workers, or other individuals entering a radiological contamination zone. Inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, the overhauling of the [US Strategic National Stockpile](https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx) will likely look to include next-generation treatments for a radiological or nuclear disaster scenario. HOPO Therapeutics is positioned to provide a best-in-class, uniquely orally-available treatment to both the US and foreign governments seeking to improve their strategic stockpile supplies.*[Read more](/publication/an-early-2017/)*


### Accidental Exposure in Nuclear Workers
Despite rigorous safety protocols, people who handle radioactive material are sometimes inadvertently exposed to elements such as uranium, plutonium, americium, and other actinides. With an accelerated schedule of [decommissioning of nuclear plants in France](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/identifying-threats/nuclear-plants-in-france-face-decommissioning/) and other countries, as well as [increased US production of plutonium-238 for space applications](https://www.ornl.gov/news/ornl-produced-plutonium-238-help-power-perseverance-mars), there is a growing workforce of nuclear workers who are currently without a safe, reliable treatment option in the event of an accidental exposure.
