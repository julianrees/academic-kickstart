### Gadolinium Deposition
There are over 15 million magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures performed in the United States each year that utilize an injected gadolinium-based contrast agent, or GBCA. The release of the toxic heavy metal gadolinium from these GBCAs *[results in gadolinium deposition](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-warns-gadolinium-based-contrast-agents-gbcas-are-retained-body)* throughout the body, and can lead to serious health complications. Currently there is no way to prevent or treat gadolinium deposition, and the diagnostic benefits of the contrast MRI are generally accepted to outweigh the risks.

In preclinical studies, our chelating agent enables the *[effective prevention of gadolinium deposition](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22511-6)*. The oral formulation of the chelator enables the course of treatment we believe will be the most effective at preventing gadolinium deposition: a regimen of pills taken in the days following contrast MRI to ensure that gadolinium released into the body from the GBCA compound will be chelated and excreted from the body, instead of depositing in the kidneys, brain, and bones.

For patients who have already received GBCAs in conjunction with an MRI procedure, we are evaluating the efficacy of our chelator for removal of pre-existing deposited gadolinium. The design of an effective dosing strategy requires a detailed knowledge of the compound's pharmacokinetics in humans - information we anticipate will be available following our first-in-human clinical trial.


### Contrast MRI for Patients with Kidney Disease
*[The American College of Radiology advises against the use of GBCAs for patients with impaired kidney function](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Clinical-Resources/Contrast_Media.pdf)* due to the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), making those individuals ineligible for MRI or MR angiography (MRA) with gadolinium-based contrast.  Instead, patients with kidney disease often undergo alternative imaging procedures using ionizing radiation, such as CT or PET. GBCAs are normally cleared from the body through the kidneys, however the primary excretion route of our chelator is via the liver. Using our chelator to reduce the strain on the kidneys associated with clearing a large dose of GBCA could enable patients with kidney disease to undergo contrast MRI and MRA procedures, giving physicians  ideal diagnostic information, and avoiding unnecessary exposure to radiation.



### Radioactive Contamination
HOPO Therapeutics' lead API and oral formulation has been designed to provide an easily distributed, effective treatment in a large-scale radiological incident. Additionally, the excellent prophylactic efficacy observed in preclinical studies suggests that the chelator can provide an effective means to protect first responders, nuclear workers, or other individuals entering a radiological contamination zone. *[Read more](/publication/an-early-2017/)*
