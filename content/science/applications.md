### Gadolinium Deposition
Our oral formulation provides the ideal modality to enable the course of treatment expected to be most effective and preventing gadolinium deposition. In the days and weeks following an injection of a GBCA, a regimen of pills ensures that gadolinium released into the body from the GBCA compound will be chelated by our API and ultimately excreted from the body.

For patients who have already received GBCAs in conjunction with an MRI procedure, we are evaluating the efficacy of our API for removal of pre-existing deposited gadolinium. The design of an effective dosing strategy requires a detailed knowledge of the API's pharmacokinetics in humans - information that will be available following our first-in-human clinical trial.



### Radioactive Contamination
Many of the same properties that make HOPO Therapeutics' API ideally suited for use in a radiological incident are similarly desirable in a treatment for gadolinium deposition, a condition that can occur as a result of exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for MRI. Also located in the f-block of the periodic table, gadolinium is effectively chelated by 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), and pre-clinical studies have shown that ***gadolinium deposition can be effectively prevented through administration of our API***.


### Rapid Clearance
Heavy metals are excreted quickly once bound by 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO). This ensures that the body is exposed to a minimum amount of radiation following exposure.

plutonium and americium. These radioactive elements, found in the actinide row of the f-block on the periodic table, are of great concern for human and environmental health in the event of a radiological incident. An effective drug treatment for exposure to these elements must be able to bind to, or ***chelate***, the toxic metal atoms, and promote their prompt excretion from the body. 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), our flagship API, has
