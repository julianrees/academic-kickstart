# Applications to Gadolinium Deposition
Many of the same properties that make HOPO Therapeutics' API ideally suited for use in a radiological incident are similarly desirable in a treatment for gadolinium deposition. Also located in the f-block of the periodic table, gadolinium is effectively chelated by 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), and pre-clinical studies have shown that gadolinium deposition can be effectively prevented through administration of our API.
