At this time, it is unfortunately not possible for us to provide, sell, or otherwise distribute investigational HOPO-based drug products, or the active pharmaceutical ingredient 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), to private individuals, organizations, or physicians outside of our established research partners. Doing so could jeopardize our ability to continue to develop the drug.

This includes any distribution through the [FDA's Expanded Access ("Compassionate Use") Program](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access), however we are exploring our options for making our products available via the Expanded Access program. We hope that in the near future we may be able to provide the investigational drug to those in need.
