### How HOPO Therapeutics May Use Your Personal Data and Other Information
By providing us with your personal data and by using our online services, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We will use the information you provide to us for our legitimate business purposes, including to respond to your requests and to provide you with information you might have requested. We may use your information to improve our products and services, or to customize your interaction with us, including the type of content that you see online or receive from us. We may use information to analyze customer interests, including analyzing website trends, and to better understand your needs and how we can improve our websites and products. We may combine information about you with information we have received from third party sources. If we deem it to be necessary, we will use your information for security purposes, such as to protect our website or our company. We may also use your information to communicate with you about our relationship, and where permitted by law, to send you information about ourselves, our products or services and other information we believe you may find of interest.  If we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority (such as reporting safety information to the Food and Drug Administration), we will disclose your information to the extent that we reasonably believe to be necessary. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party in connection with the sale, transfer or reorganization of some or all of HOPO Therapeutics or its assets, and any such acquirer or transferee will have the right to use and disclose such information subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your personal data and other non-personal information to our third-party service providers (e.g., hosting providers, payment processors, analytics companies, etc.). If we supply information to these third parties, we will require them to use it only for the purpose for which they are working with us, and prohibit disclosure except at our direction and consistent with the services they are contracted to provide

### Use of Aggregate Information
Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new services and tailor existing services to customer desires. We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of HOPO Therapeutics.
