The [Bakar Fellows Program](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/bakarfellows/about), a highly competitive faculty entrepreneurship initiative at the University of California, Berkeley, has selected the founding team of HOPO Therapeutics, Inc. for their [2021 cohort](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/bakarfellows/2021-2022-fellows). This funding will support research and development activities to further the commercialization of our lead drug compound, 3,4,3,-LI(1,2-HOPO), as well as market and patient research aimed at identifying underlying causes and risk factors for increased retention of gadolinium following MRI contrast administration.
