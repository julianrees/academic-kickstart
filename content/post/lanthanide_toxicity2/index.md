Co-founder Rebecca Abergel, Ph.D. [spoke to Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/04/30/the-u-s-is-trying-to-reclaim-its-rare-earth-mantle/) about how rare earth elements such as gadolinium are used, produced, and purified.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a Department of Energy National Lab and home to the [BioActinide Chemistry group](http://abergel.lbl.gov), also [covered this recent discovery](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/06/07/heavy-metals-disease-yeast/) and its applications for new discoveries in lanthanide toxicity and human health.

HOPO Therapeutics develops safe and orally-available chelating agents that bind to and remove heavy metals from the body. Originally [designed for use in a nuclear disaster scenario](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2019/09/12/how-an-anti-nuclear-contamination-pill-could-also-help-mri-patients/), new applications for [exposure to gadolinium](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-22511-6), [lead, cadmium](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7NJ04559J), and a range of other heavy metals are being studied. *[Learn more about our science](../../science/)*
