**We envision** a world where lead poisoning is treatable. Where children can safely grow up in an older home with lead paint or pipes. Where the transgenerational consequences of lead poisoning cease to plague low-income and vulnerable communities around the world.

**Our mission** is to improve the lives and futures of children, families, and communities living with the effects of lead poisoning. We accomplish this through world-class science and the development of innovative therapeutics specifically designed to provide safe, durable treatment for heavy metal poisoning.

We are uncompromising on **our core values:** that our science be exceptional, our treatments be accessible, and that our patients always remain at the forefront of everything we do. We believe that no child should be disadvantaged simply by the quality of their water, the age of their home, or their proximity to industrial pollutants.
