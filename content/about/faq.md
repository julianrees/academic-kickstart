<center> <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1> </center>
<br>

1. **What is HOPO? What does it do?** <br>
*The investigational drug HOPO 14-1 contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), a metal chelator. It has been specifically designed to selectively bind heavy metals and promote their removal from the body, without disrupting the body's store of essential metals like iron, calcium, and zinc.*

1. **What kinds of metals does HOPO 14-1 chelate?** <br>
*Based on the available data, HOPO 14-1 chelates and promotes the removal of most lanthanide and actinide elements from the body. This includes gadolinium, as well as radioactive elements like uranium, plutonium, and americium. Additionally, HOPO can chelate other heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and tin.*

1. **Will HOPO 14-1 chelate deposited gadolinium that is "free" *AND* gadolinium still bound to a GBCA chelator?** <br>
*Based on the available data, yes. However, the extent of its effectiveness for these scenarios is currently being studied.*

1. **Could HOPO 14-1 help communities impacted by lead or other heavy metal poisoning?** <br>
*Again based on the available data, yes, we do anticipate being able to help address heavy metal poisoning of many types. We are aiming to answer these questions as we move into clinical trials.*


1. **Can I purchase or obtain HOPO 14-1?** <br>
*At the moment, unfortunately no. Please take a look at our statement regarding the [availability of our investigational drug](../availability).*

1. **Can you answer questions or provide medical advice about metal toxicity or chelation treatments?** <br>
*No, we cannot provide any medical advice. Questions about exposure to or toxicity from heavy metals, courses of treatment, recommended chelators, symptoms related to heavy metal contamination, or any other heath-related topics should be directed to your physician.*

1. **What can I do to stay informed about your progress?** <br>
*For shorter, more frequent updates, you can check the [News](../#posts) page of our website, or follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hopotx). We also publish more comprehensive updates via our mailing list - please sign up [here!](../#contact)*

1. **When will you be starting clinical trials?** <br>
*HOPO 14-1 has been granted Investigational New Drug status by the FDA, meaning it has been shown to be both safe and effective in preclinical studies. We have cleared all of the regulatory milestones necessary to begin clinical trials, and we are seeking funding for them. We anticipate conducting clinical trials - once it is safe to do so - to assess both safety and pharmacokinetics, as well as efficacy for chelation of gadolinium.*

1. **Can I sign up to participate in a clinical trial?** <br>
*We are not currently enrolling participants in any clinical trials. When we have funding and approval to begin enrolling clinical trials, we will make announcements on our website and via [our mailing list](../#contact) - please consider signing up if you would like to be notified.*

1. **I still have questions - who can I contact for more information?** <br>
*Our [contact information is here](../#contact). We regret that due to a large volume of inquiries, it may take us some time to reply depending on the nature of your message. We need to reiterate that HOPO 14-1 is not available at this time.*
