Such high thermodynamic stabilities not only confirm the unparalleled Pu(IV) affinity of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) as a decorporation agent but also corroborate the great potential of hydroxypyridinonate ligands as new (89)Zr-chelating platforms for immuno-PET applications. These experimental values are in excellent agreement with previous estimates and are discussed with respect to ionic radius and electronic configuration, in comparison with those of Ce(IV) and Th(IV).

	abstract = {With DTPA as a comparison, the siderophore analogue 3,4,3-LIHOPO has been examined for its ability to remove 238Pu and 241Am from the rat after subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramuscular (i.m.) injection of about 200 Bq of each actinide (0.3 ng Pu, 1.6 ng Am). After the s.c. deposition of 238Pu and 241Am, both ligands were more effective after local administration than (in decreasing order) their repeated interperitoneal (i.p.) injection, single i.p. injection and continuous infusion. Dosages of 3 mumol kg-1 of 3,4,3-LIHOPO were at least as effective as 30 mumol kg-1 DTPA after each mode of administration. The most effective regimen of those investigated for s.c. 238Pu and 241Am involved local administration of 30 mumol kg-1 of 3,4,3-LIHOPO at 30 min followed by i.p. injections at 6 h, 1, 2 and 3 day. By day 7 after exposure, the amounts of 238Pu and 241Am retained in the body were 2 and 7\% of those in controls, respectively and 10 and four times less than when DTPA was administered using the same regimen. The ligand 3,4,3-LIHOPO was more effective for 238Pu and 241Am after their i.m. injection. This was attributed to the greater retention of these actinides at the wound site (97 versus 67\%) when treatment commenced. After a single local injection of 30 mumol kg-1 at 30 min, the amounts of 238Pu and 241Am retained in the body at 7 day were 0.9 and 0.8\% of controls. These values were 34 and 27 times less than after local and repeated i.p. injections of DTPA at dosages of 30 mumol kg-1. It is concluded that the administration of 3,4,3-LIHOPO represents potentially a most significant advance in the treatment of wound contamination by 238Pu and 241Am by chelating agents.},

The remarkably high affinity of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) for lanthanide metal ions and the resulting high complex stabilities (pM values ranging from 17.2 for La(III) to 23.1 for Yb(III)) constitute a necessary but not sufficient criterion to consider this octadentate ligand an optimal candidate for in vivo metal decorporation. The in vivo lanthanide complex stability and decorporation capacity of the ligand were assessed, using the radioactive isotope (152)Eu as a tracer in a rodent model, which provided a direct comparison with the in vitro thermodynamic results and demonstrated the great potential of 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) as a therapeutic metal chelating agent.},

	abstract = {The hydroxypyridinonate ligand 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) is currently under development for radionuclide chelation therapy. The preclinical characterization of this highly promising ligand comprised the evaluation of its in vitro properties, including microsomal, plasma, and gastrointestinal fluid stability, cytochrome P450 inhibition, plasma protein binding, and intestinal absorption using the Caco-2 cell line. When mixed with active human liver microsomes, no loss of parent compound was observed after 60 min, indicating compound stability in the presence of liver microsomal P450. At the tested concentrations, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) did not significantly influence the activities of any of the cytochromal isoforms screened. Thus, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) is unlikely to cause drug–drug interactions by inhibiting the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Plasma protein-binding assays revealed that the compound is protein-bound in dogs and less extensively in rats and humans. In the plasma stability study, the compound was stable after 1 h at 37°C in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma samples. Finally, a bidirectional permeability assay demonstrated that 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) is not permeable across the Caco-2 monolayer, highlighting the need to further evaluate the effects of various compounds with known permeability enhancement properties on the permeability of the ligand in future studies.

	abstract = {The potential consequences of a major radiological event are not only large-scale external radiation exposure of the population, but also uncontrolled dissemination of, and internal contamination with, radionuclides. When planning an emergency response to radiological and nuclear incidents, one must consider the need for not only post-exposure treatment for contaminated individuals, but also prophylactic measures to protect the workforce facing contaminated areas and patients in the aftermath of such events. In addition to meeting the desired criteria for post-exposure treatments such as safety, ease of administration, and broad-spectrum efficacy against multiple radionuclides and levels of challenge, ideal prophylactic countermeasures must include rapid onset; induce minimal to no performance-decrementing side effects; be compatible with current military Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive countermeasures; and require minimal logistical burdens. Hydroxypyridinone-based actinide decorporation agents have shown the most promise as decorporation strategies for various radionuclides of concern, including the actinides plutonium and americium. The studies presented here probe the extent of plutonium decorporation efficacy for two chelating agents, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) and 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO), from early pre-exposure time points to a delay of up to 7 days in parenteral or oral treatment administration, i.e., well beyond the initial hours of emergency response. Despite delayed treatment after a contamination event, both ligands clearly enhanced plutonium elimination through the investigated 7-day post-treatment period. In addition, a remarkable prophylactic efficacy was revealed for 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) with treatment as early as 48??h before the plutonium challenge. This work provides new perspectives in the indication and use of experimental actinide decorporation treatments.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE To identify the most effective multidentate 1,2-HOPO and Me-3,2-HOPO ligands for chelation of Pu(IV) in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two sets of ligands with four identical backbones were prepared containing two, three or four bidentate 1,2-HOPO or Me-3,2-HOPO groups, and 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) was resynthesized in a higher yielding procedure. They were evaluated in mouse for acute toxicity and reduction of tissue 238Pu, in comparison with CaNa3-DTPA (30 micromol kg(-1)). RESULTS Nine HOPO ligands, promptly injected or given orally or injected at low dosage, are superior to CaNa3-DTPA for reducing 238Pu retention in mouse. Five, given by delayed injection or promptly injected or orally administered as ferric complexes, are superior to CaNa3-DTPA or FeNa2-DTPA respectively. The Me-3,2-HOPO ligands are more effective than their structural 1,2-HOPO analogues, demonstrating the greater affinity of Me-3,2-HOPO for Pu(IV) in vivo. CONCLUSIONS The most efficacious ligand, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), contains the less stably binding 1,2-HOPO group; therefore, its linear spermine backbone must confer advantages for Pu(IV) binding (greater solubility, more favorable arrangement of ligating groups, more flexible backbone). Effective low toxicity tetradentate 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) and hexadentate TREN-(Me-3,2-HOPO) and highly effective but moderately toxic 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (LD50 approximately 300 micromol kg(-1) in mouse) are recommended for further investigation.},

Such bioanalytical methods were developed with rat plasma, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, and have a detection range of 0.05 to 2.5 μg/mL and 0.1 to 5 μg/mL for 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) and 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), respectively. These methods were used to determine the in vivo plasma pharmacokinetics of the free acid and four salt forms of each ligand after a single intravenous or oral administration in rats.

	abstract = {Two hydroxypyridinone-containing actinide decorporation agents, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) and 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO), are being developed for the treatment of internal actinide contamination by chelation therapy. Dose-response efficacy profiles in mice were established for the removal of intravenously injected (238)Pu and (241)Am after parenteral and oral treatment with these chelators. In both cases, presumed efficacious doses promoted substantially greater actinide elimination rates than the currently approved agent, diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid, considering two different interspecies scaling methods for the conversion of human doses to equivalent rodent dose levels. In addition, genotoxicity of both ligands was assessed using the Salmonella/ Escherichia coli /microsome plate incorporation test and the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay, showing that neither ligand is genotoxic, in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Finally, maximum tolerated dose studies were performed in rats for seven consecutive daily oral administrations with the chelators, confirming the safety of the presumed efficacious doses for 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) and 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO). The results of these studies add to the growing body of evidence that both decorporation agents have remarkable decorporation efficacy properties and promising safety toxicology profiles. These results are necessary components of the regulatory approval process and will help determine the optimal human dosing regimens for the treatment of internal radionuclide contamination.},
